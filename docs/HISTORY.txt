Changelog
=========

2.5 (unreleased)
----------------

- use Vector instead of GML layers for openlayers 2.12, add js for popups

  [nan]

- KML Documents download with the relevant context's ID (`id.kml`) as their
  filename rather than ``@@kml-document``.

  [rockdj]

  panel.
  [rockdj]

  view, with the styles managed through the relevant annotation.
  [rockdj]
* Added standard above-content elements to the KML-openlayers view
  (byline, description, etc).
  [rockdj]
* Updated the kml_openlayers.js Javascript to handle the case of
  accessing the KML-openlayers view directly.
  [rockdj]
* Changed KML links to content to point to the content's *View* action
  if their portal type is set that way in the Site Properties.  This
  follows in the same manner as views like the Folder Summary View.
  [rockdj]

  content item in KML view.  This allows direct access to the content's
  methods and properties (eg for image display, see below)

  [rockdj]
* Changed linewidth to be able to accept float values.
  [rockdj]
* Integrated zgeo.plone.kml package.
* Updated the kml_openlayers.js Javascript to use the current URL's
  context to access @@kml-document.  Accessing this in a relative manner
  represents problems for URLs being rewritten in a proxy (eg Deliverance).
  [rockdj]
* Renamed Kml Layer

----------------

* Initial release
