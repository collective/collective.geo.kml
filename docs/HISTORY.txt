Changelog
=========

0.2 (unreleased)
----------------

* Changed KML links to content to point to the content's *View* action
  if their portal type is set that way in the Site Properties.  This
  follows in the same manner as views like the Folder Summary View.
  [rockdj]
* Added *dc* object to BrainPlacemark to allow access to original 
  content item in KML view.  This allows direct access to the content's
  methods and properties (eg for image display, see below)
  [rockdj]
* Allowed KML feature/placemark description to display image thumbnail
  if the content possesses such (eg Images and News Items).  Images are
  displayed in same style as that of the Folder Summary View.
  [rockdj]
* Added extra metadata into KML feature/placemark output (item type, 
  modification date, creation date)
  [rockdj]
* Changed KML output to exclude feature/placemark description tag
  on no content description being present.
  [rockdj]
* Added uninstall GenericSetup profile
  [rockdj]
* Added action for downloading KML to desktop (for Google Earth or 
  other applications)
  [rockdj]
* Added ability to set marker image size in control panel
  [rockdj]
* Allowed for marker image not have to be in the hard-coded /img/ directory.
  This allows for custom markers to be specified anywhere in Plone.
  img/marker.png is set as default to keep things the same.
  [rockdj]
* Changed linewidth to be able to accept float values.
  [rockdj]
* Integrated zgeo.plone.kml package.
* Updated the kml_openlayers.js Javascript to use the current URL's
  context to access @@kml-document.  Accessing this in a relative manner
  represents problems for URLs being rewritten in a proxy (eg Deliverance).
  [rockdj]
* Renamed Kml Layer
