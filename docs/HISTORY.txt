  [rockdj]
* retrieve default customised styles from those set in the site's control
  panel.
  [rockdj]
* moved the link to the given content in the KML view to be the title.
  [rockdj]

  testing customised styles)
  [rockdj]

  view, with the styles managed through the relevant annotation.
  [rockdj]
* added standard above-content elements to the KML-openlayers view
  (byline, description, etc).
  [rockdj]
* updated the kml_openlayers.js Javascript to handle the case of
  accessing the KML-openlayers view directly.
  [rockdj]
* changed KML links to content to point to the content's *View* action
  if their portal type is set that way in the Site Properties.  This
  follows in the same manner as views like the Folder Summary View.
  [rockdj]

  content item in KML view.  This allows direct access to the content's
  methods and properties (eg for image display, see below)

  This allows for custom markers to be specified anywhere in Plone.
  img/marker.png is set as default to keep things the same.
  [rockdj]
* changed linewidth to be able to accept float values.
  [rockdj]
* integrated zgeo.plone.kml package.
* updated the kml_openlayers.js Javascript to use the current URL's
  context to access @@kml-document.  Accessing this in a relative manner
  represents problems for URLs being rewritten in a proxy (eg Deliverance).
  [rockdj]
* renamed Kml Layer
